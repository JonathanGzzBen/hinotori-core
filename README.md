# hinotori-core

Core library for `hinotori` software, which includes `hinotori-cli` and `hinotori-desktop`, both currently in
development.

`hinotori` allows studying questionnaires stored in easy to understand human-readable `json` files.

I admire Kiara, a multilingual Virtual Youtuber from HoloEn who speaks English, Japanese, German and "Bird" (she is a
phoenix so that is obvious), and want to re-learn the languages I have mostly forgotten, and take up on learning
japanese, so I started the development of this family of software that will allow anyone to write their own
questionnaires (and share them) to study.

# Hinotori

**Hinotori** is the romanized version of **火の鳥**, which means **Phoenix** in japanese.

The phoenix is the symbol of undying perseverance, overcoming darkness in spite of the expected opposition and blockade
towards its goals. It goes on, rising to the challenge, unwavering in its struggle towards the accomplishment of its
mission to become powerful, knowledgeable and successful.

> *"Our passions are the true phoenixes; when the old one is burnt out, a new one rises from its ashes."*

> **Johann Wolfgang von Goethe**
